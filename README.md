# medical-center-management
A web based Online Medical Center Management System (for ENIEM Medical Center)

# Problem Statement
Managing the large number of patient records in a medical center manually becomes very difficult. A doctor must remember the problems of his patients, follow the development of their medical condition especially for chronic diseases and have in mind all that is in their medical records at the time of the consultation


# Project Overview

This system will provide a graphical user interface to maintain the entire system, including patient prescription, medication delivery, patient record management etc. In addition, the new system will be accessible from the terminals of the medical center.
